## Android application

This repository contains the Ambience Android application source code.

The application opens a TCP connection with the ESP8266 board and sends 3 bytes,
representing the intensity of the Red, Green, and Blue lights, respectively.

Color is set via a color picker from the QuadFlask library.

Light intensity is set via a slide bar.

## Libraries

This project uses the [`QuadFlask.colorpicker`](https://github.com/QuadFlask/colorpicker) 
library for the color picker.
